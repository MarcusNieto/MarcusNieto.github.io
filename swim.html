      <p>The swim leg during a triathlon can be desribed using only one word: chaos. In a large race, hundreds of participants will start at the same time. You get kicked, slapped in the head and water is splashing all around for what seems like hours. In reality, the madness only lasts a couple of minutes until the field is stretched out based on swimming ability. A normal race will include an open water swim; meaning in an actual body of water like a river, lake or the ocean. This means that there is no black line to follow like there is in a swimming pool. Open water swimmers must look forward after every few strokes and swim towards a point on the horizon, normally some form of brightly-colored buoy. Depending on the water temperature, racers may be allowed to wear a wetsuit. A wetsuit serves two functions, to keep the person warmer and to provide better buoyancy making the swimmer faster in the water. Once the racer has completed the swim leg, they will run up the shoreline to the transition area. The transition area is where the racer stores their bike and running gear. After the swim, the racer must run through a sea of bikes to find their own, quickly take off their wetsuit and put their helmet on. Experienced racers have excellent muscle memory and can complete the swim-to-bike transition in less than one minute.</p>
