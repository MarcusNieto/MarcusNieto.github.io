    <p>Once the athlete has completed the bike leg, they return to the transition area, find their original spot on the rack and rack their bike. They put on their running shoes, grab a quick drink of water and a hat and head out on the final leg of the race; the run. The first quarter-mile or so the runners legs will feel like jello after riding the bike. But eventually this feeling will subside and they will be able to run at full stride. The race all comes together during the run. It is when the athlete finds out if they properly paced themselves and took in the proper nutrition. If they went oo hard on the bike, they will quickly pay for it as their body gives out and they are forced to walk or drop out, it happens all the time. This is the real strategy of triathlon, and what many people don't fully understand. Most think it's just go as hard as you can in each discipline and the fastest will come out on top. In reality, racing is all about knowing your strengths and how to exploit them, as well as mitigate the effects of your weaknesses.
