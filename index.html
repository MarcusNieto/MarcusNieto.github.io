  <h1>Hello world, is this thing on?</h1>
  <body>
  <p> Hey everybody, my name is Marcus. I am 29 years old and I was born to a military family so we moved around quite a bit until I was about 10. Most recently my family and I
    lived in Chicago. It was from there that I joined the Air Force when I was 21 years old. After basic training and tech school I became an Air Traffic Control Apprentice at
    Cannon AFB, New Mexico. I spent five long years there before finally receiving orders to Osan AB, Korea. Korea was an adventure and a very eye-opening experience, having never
    been out of the country before. After Korea I came to Moody AFB, GA where I currently reside. I live here with my wife and two kids. The next step on my journey is being stationed 
    at Lajes AB, Azores Portugal which I leave in August this year for. </p>

  <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
  <h3> Triathlon </h3>
  <p> My first hobby is Triathlon and it definitely takes up the majority of my time. Growing up I always loved running and swimming. When I signed up and participated in my first race
    I was immediately hooked. Triathlon is an event that combines three disciplines; swimming, biking and running. There are several different distance races and it is an absolute great
    way to stay in shape.</p>

  <p> I use several different websites to assist in the planning and tracking of progress with triathlon. They are linked below. The first is polar.com which is the website my watch syncs
    to which tracks all workouts and sleep. The second is the website for 80/20 triathlon where all my training plans come from. And finally the last is trifind.com which I use to search
    and register for races all over the country. </p>
