  <h1>Hello world, is this thing on?</h1>
  <p> Hey everybody, my name is Marcus. I am 29 years old and I was born to a military family so we moved around quite a bit until I was about 10. Most recently my family and I
    lived in Chicago. It was from there that I joined the Air Force when I was 21 years old. After basic training and tech school I became an Air Traffic Control Apprentice at
    Cannon AFB, New Mexico. I spent five long years there before finally receiving orders to Osan AB, Korea. Korea was an adventure and a very eye-opening experience, having never
    been out of the country before. After Korea I came to Moody AFB, GA where I currently reside. I live here with my wife and two kids. The next step on my journey is being stationed 
    at Lajes AB, Azores Portugal which I lieave for in August this year. </p>
  
  <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
  <h3> Triathlon </h3>
  <p> My first hobby is Triathlon and it definitely takes up the majority of my time. Growing up I always loved running and swimming. When I signed up and participated in my first race
    I was immediately hooked. </p>
