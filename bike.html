    <p>The bike portion of any race will generally take up half of the total race time to complete, no matter if it is a sprint or Ironman distance. In order to be competitive in racing, one must be proficient on the bike. A triathlon bike looks somewhat different from a standard road bike. As you can see in the picture to the right, Lionel Sanders is using what is called the "Aero Position". Meaning he is hunched forward trying to make his back as flat as possible. His arms are extended forward and his head is looking up so he is able to see forward. This is because in almost all triathlons, drafting is illegal. This means you must keep at least three bike lengths between you and the rider in front of you. The goal is to be as aerodynamic as possible to maximize energy efficiency. The most important thing is the bike fit. The fit is how the bike is situated to match the rider's body. This includes the seat height, and fore/aft position as well as the position of the aero bars. For more information on how to set bike fit, see the video embedded below. The other major difference between a triathlon bike and a standard road bike is the seat. Most people are familiar with the standard bike seat. A triathlon seat is different in that they normally will be slightly shorter and many will have two "noses". This allows the rider to rotate forward, as depicted here on the right. The two noses allow the rider's weight to be supported by the pelvis instead of placing pressure on the groin. </p>
